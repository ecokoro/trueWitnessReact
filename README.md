# trueWitnessReact
Running the Project

Fresh clone of repository

cd frontend/TrueWitness

npm install
check to see if expo-cli is installed on the system: the package.json only has expo as a dependency

if missing npm install --global expo-cli

to start the web server: npx expo web



Openning the project on your mobile device instead of an emulator

Downlod the Expo app from the Google play store or app store (ios)
Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder frontend/TrueWitness and run the command npx expo start to start the server
A QR code will be shown in the terminal/command prompt that you need to scan with your phone
Once scanned, select the popup that asks to open the Expo app

Helpful tips



You have to be on the same wifi/lan network as the computer you're working on for this to work.
If it keeps crashing. Clear the cache and data of the expo app from your phone settings.
Always scan the QR code from the terminal as opposed to the browser.
