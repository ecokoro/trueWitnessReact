# API
## Spinning up local copy after cloning project (checkout dev) [MacOS, Linux, Windows]
1. `cd API`
2. `npm install`
3. `npx nodemon start`

these three commands will run the default start script present in the **package.json** file. After the install you only need to run the third command. By default the API is started on port 3000.
